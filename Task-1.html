    <p>
        The values of fuel consumptions, CO2 emissions and energy consumptions shown are based on the new WLTP test-cycle and determined according to the European Regulation (EC) 715/2007 in the version applicable at the time of type approval. The figures shown consider optional equipment and the different size of wheels and tyres available on the selected model. Changes of the configuration can lead to changes of the values. <br><br>
        For vehicle related taxes or other duties based (at least inter alia) on CO2 emissions the CO2 values may differ to the values stated here. They do not relate to any one particular vehicle, nor are they part of any offer made, rather they are solely for the purpose of comparing different kinds of vehicle.
